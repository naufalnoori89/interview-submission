    "# Interview Solution By Naufal Mohamed Noori\n",
    "\n",
    "(Date: 28 December 2025)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "To design and develop a data warehouse using industrial-standard framework from 3 possible datalake inputs for latter consumption by data analyst, machine learning, analystic, and technology in usable formats dictated (AWS, GCP, Azure, Snowflake, local dbt, etc.) .\n",
    "\n",
    "Inputs:\n",
    "1. CRM System - contact information, demographic information, email communications, call recordings, form submissions. \n",
    "2. Events System - registrations and attendance at student events\n",
    "3. Application System - applications, education history and qualifications, statuses, certifications. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Solution\n",
    "The final solution consists of gold layer data which has been transformed from the input silver layer. The solution will show aggregated result of the effectiveness for each of the methods utilized CRM, events, and applications based on the engagement made by students.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Proposed Architecture\n",
    "I will be using medallion architecture approach to produce the final datatype consumable by various parties stated above. The medallion architecture is widely used in a lot of modern ETL tool like databricks. The proposed pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Source --> Data Ingestion (Landing) --> Broze Layer (Raw Data) --> Silver Later (Cleaned Data) --> Gold Layer (Transformed Data) --> Consumption (Data Ready For Users)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Source\n",
    "- CRM (contacts, emails, calls, forms)\n",
    "- Events (registrations, attendance)\n",
    "- Applications (education history, status changes)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data Ingestion\n",
    "- This part is quite tricky as no 'clear' input stated from the interview documents. Hence I will make assumption that the data will come from a database and will be fetch in batch. 'Dummy' data will be created from all 3 possible sources to showcase the migration between each layer in the pipeline. As known there are bunch of sandbox opensource data related to the CRM etc out there but fro simplicity I am going to create the dummy data from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Bronze Layer (Raw data)\n",
    "- Just an exact copy of the data pulled out from ingestion. Usually data organization are done here from unstructured and structred data. However, as simplication made in this demo we only need to deal with structure data from a simple 'demo' database\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Silver Layer (Cleaned)\n",
    "At this stage, I will perform various standard data cleanup as follows:\n",
    "    - Standardized IDs\n",
    "    - Clean timestamps\n",
    "    - Remove duplicates\n",
    "    - Handling null values (Depends if we determine null is not ok for certain column)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Gold Layer (Transformed)\n",
    "The last stage is to create a final analytic transformed data ready for end user consumption. For this demo, I will focus on 3 outputs which are:\n",
    "    - Student Dimension\n",
    "        - This table will emphasizes on the student details, the origin of the students, and the program the applied for\n",
    "    - Student Engagement\n",
    "        - This tabe will emphasize on student interaction with QS application via emails or web appplication or any other mean of engagements (Physical signup etc). \n",
    "    - Aggregated Engagement Scores\n",
    "        - This will contains some score of engagement which gauges value the students' level of connection/interest to QS\n",
    "\n",
    "### Consumption\n",
    "The final data are ready to be used by:\n",
    "- BI Dashboards\n",
    "- Data Science Models\n",
    "- AI (If we are to handle and train ML model etc in our ETL pipeline - but in our simple case it is not - this will be the answer for the enhancement question)\n",

    "Additional Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tDescribe how you would handle ingestion and orchestration\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Handling ingestion using probably databricks bulit in workflow. Using pyspark to orchestrate big data.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tDescribe how this data will be used downstream and how it helps the business achieve the objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - As mentioned earlier, data con be consumed by tool olike Power BI or business manager to approach prospective student or even any scheduler/cron backend application to send out email/whatsapp follow up to prospective students.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\t[Optional] If you are comfortable with graph thinking, sketch how this would map to node-edge form. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Simple node drawn in first markdown page\n",
    "\n",
    "•\t[Optional] Include tools and services involved in the implementation of this model. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Databricks, pandas, pyspark\n",
    "\n",
    "•\t[Optional] Include other aspects of the solution that you believe would be critical to its success, e.g. data lineage, access controls, data delivery mechanisms, AI enablement, real-time data streaming.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - We can also use a json schema with versioninig, acl, entitlement groups so backend application will consume the records and control all the relevant functionality and security accordingly. One of the example I am currently utilize is here: \n",
    "\n",
    "    [Link Here](https://community.opengroup.org/osdu/data/data-definitions)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "•\t[Optional] Propose further enhancements in Phase 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Include machine learning model training within the pipeline. Use viable machine learning algorith from Keras to refine and train ML model for end user consumption. At the end, we can predict prospective students based on criteria given and focusing on them starts from the application submission until results.\n"
